## Description
Pong is a clasical arcade game that was created by Atari in the 70's. 
The game was played by two players.
Each player has controll over his/her own paddle which could only move vertically across the left/right side of the screen.
The goal of the game was to hit the moving ball and hope that the other player would miss it.
If the oponent does miss it, then you get a point. The winner is the first to reach 11 points. <br>
This version is a mimication of the good old Atari Pong using Lua's 2d framework LÖVE2D. </p>
